## SQL Project

This project covers SQL fundamentals and is designed to be completed using MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The tasks include listing databases, creating and deleting databases, managing tables, and performing various CRUD operations.

Here's a brief overview of what I covered when learning:
