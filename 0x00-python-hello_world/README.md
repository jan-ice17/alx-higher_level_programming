# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks as part of the "0x00. Python - Hello, World" project. The tasks cover fundamental concepts in Python programming, including printing, formatting, string manipulation, and basic scripting.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **File 0-run:** A Shell script that runs a Python script specified in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.
- **File 1-run_inline:** A Shell script that runs Python code specified in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.
- **File 3-print_number.py:** Python script that prints an integer followed by "Battery street."
- **File 4-print_float.py:** Python script that prints a float with a precision of 2 digits.
- **File 6-concat.py:** Python script that concatenates and prints strings.
- **File 7-edges.py:** Python script that extracts and prints specific parts of a string.
- **File 9-easter_egg.py:** Python script that prints a specific sentence.

## Requirements

- All Python scripts are expected to be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Shell scripts and C scripts have specific requirements outlined in the individual task descriptions.
- Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) is used for code styling.

## How to Run

Instructions on how to run each script are provided in the respective task descriptions.
