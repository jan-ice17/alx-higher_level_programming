ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Import & Modules

Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file
Objective: Import a function from a separate file and demonstrate its usage.
create a program (0-add.py) that imports the add function from add_0.py.
Use the imported function to add two predefined values and print the result.

Task 1: My first toolbox!
Objective: Import multiple functions from a file and perform mathematical operations.
Develop a program (1-calculation.py) that imports functions from calculator_1.py.
Utilize the imported functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and print the results.

Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!
Objective: Create a program that prints information about command line arguments.
Implement a program (2-args.py) that displays the number of arguments and their values.
Handle different cases, such as no arguments, one argument, and multiple arguments.

Task 3: Infinite addition
Objective: Write a program that performs the addition of an arbitrary number of arguments.
Develop a program (3-infinite_add.py) that adds all the command line arguments and prints the result.
Handle both positive and negative integers, as well as large numbers.

Task 4: Who are you?
Objective: Print names defined in a compiled module.
Create a program (4-hidden_discovery.py) that prints names defined in the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
Display names in alphabetical order, excluding those starting with double underscores.

Task 5: Everything can be imported
Objective: Import a variable from a file and print its value.
Develop a program (5-variable_load.py) that imports the variable a from variable_load_5.py and prints its value.


Advanced Task: Build my own calculator!
Objective: Create a calculator program that handles basic operations.
Implement a program (100-my_calculator.py) that takes three arguments (a, operator, b) and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the operator.

Advanced Task: Easy print
Objective: Write a program that prints a specific message in the standard output.
Develop a program (101-easy_print.py) that prints "#pythoniscool" in the standard output.

Advanced Task: ByteCode -> Python #3
Objective: Write a Python function based on given bytecode.
Create a Python function (102-magic_calculation.py) that produces the same results as a provided Python bytecode.

Advanced Task: Fast alphabet
Objective: Print the alphabet in uppercase in a concise manner.
Develop a program (103-fast_alphabet.py) that prints the uppercase alphabet in three lines without using loops, conditional statements, or string literals.
