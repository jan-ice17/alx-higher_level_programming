Project 0x01: Python - if/else, loops, functions
Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
In this task, I created a Python script (0-positive_or_negative.py) that assigns a random signed number to a variable (number) each time it is executed. The script then prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

Task 1: The last digit
For this task, I implemented a Python script (1-last_digit.py) that assigns a random signed number to a variable (number) and prints the last digit of that number along with some conditions based on its value.

Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
In this task, I wrote a Python script (2-print_alphabet.py) that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without a newline character. Only one print function and one loop were allowed, and importing modules was prohibited.

Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
The script (3-print_alphabt.py) for this task prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. Similar to the previous task, only one print function and one loop were allowed, with no character storage or module imports.

Task 4: Hexadecimal printing
For this task, I created a Python script (4-print_hexa.py) that prints decimal numbers from 0 to 98 along with their hexadecimal representation. The script adheres to the constraints of using only one print function and one loop, without storing numbers or importing modules.

Task 5: 00...99
In this task, I implemented a Python script (5-print_comb2.py) that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces. The last number is followed by a newline character. The script meets the requirements of using no more than 2 print functions and one loop, without storing numbers or importing modules.

Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials...
The Python script (6-print_comb3.py) for this task prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces. Only the smallest combination is printed, and the numbers are in ascending order. Constraints include using no more than 3 print functions and 2 loops, without storing numbers or importing modules.

Task 7: islower
I implemented a Python function (7-islower.py) that checks if a given character is lowercase. The function returns True if the character is lowercase and False otherwise. Importing modules and using str.upper() and str.isupper() were not allowed.

Task 8: To uppercase
The Python function (8-uppercase.py) in this task prints a given string in uppercase followed by a newline character. Constraints include using no more than 2 print functions, one loop, and not using str.upper() and str.isupper().

Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
The Python function (9-print_last_digit.py) prints the last digit of a given number. The function also returns the value of the last digit. No module imports were allowed.

Task 10: a + b
For this task, I created a Python function (10-add.py) that adds two integers and returns the result. No module imports were allowed.

Task 11: a ^ b
In this task, I implemented a Python function (11-pow.py) that computes a to the power of b and returns the value. No module imports were allowed.

Task 12: Fizz Buzz
The Python function (12-fizzbuzz.py) for this task prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz." The numbers are separated by spaces, and each element is followed by a space.

Task 13: Insert in sorted linked list
The C function (13-insert_number.c) inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. The function returns the address of the new node or NULL if it fails. The lists.h header file provides the necessary data structures and function prototypes.
